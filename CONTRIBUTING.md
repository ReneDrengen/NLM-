# Contributing to Moshi

## Pull Requests

Moshi is the implementation of a research paper.
Therefore, we do not plan on accepting many pull requests for new features.
We certainly welcome them for bug fixes.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass properly, in particular the linting and typing.
4. Accept the Contributor License Agreement (see after).

Note that in general we will not accept refactoring of the code.


## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a Contributtor License Agreement.
